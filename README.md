As part of the HDSI Agri Datathon 2024 project, we analyzed farmer demographics and productivity across over 3,000 U.S. counties. We used NASS data, adjusted for inflation to accurately assess crop sales trends. After cleaning the data—removing columns with 50% missing values, filtering out rows with NaNs, and merging "operators" and "producers"—we calculated average sales per operation as our productivity measure and categorized counties into the top and bottom 25%. Our polynomial regression model captured the relationship between farmer age and productivity, achieving MSEs of 5.658 (top counties) and 3.012 (bottom counties), which revealed key non-linear trends.
